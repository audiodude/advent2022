# Travis Briggs' Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

**SPOILERS AHEAD!**

Puzzle input and solutions for Advent of Code 2022

---

Note that if you haven't completed the puzzles for the years specified, this
repo and the ones linked will contain **spoilers**/working solutions for how to
finish them.

I have been doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for several years.
Often, I would "save up" the puzzles for when I had downtime around holiday
breaks and try to cram them all at once. This was definitely a recipe for
burnout. Last year (2021), I decided to do them as they come out and got much
farther (to puzzle 18 completed).

I am doing this challenge in Python because of it's excellent looping, data
structure, and string handling capabilities. More to the point, I know Python
well and would rather just solve the puzzles than contend with learning a new
programming language (though I have tried that in the past with Go).

## Optimal solutions

I don't spend much time looking to optimize my solutions or ["code
golfing"](https://code.golf/). Sometimes my naive algorithm will result in a
solution that takes up too much memory or too much time to run. In those cases I
try to find a better solution. But if I can get a right answer in under 5
minutes, I usually go with it.

## Puzzle input

I usually commit my puzzle input, in case I want to go back and run one of the
solutions again, so I don't have to look it up on the website. For this year
(2022), I'm planning on committing the sample input as well. I almost always run
my solution over the sample input (because it comes with an answer), but haven't
been in the habit of committing the result.
